# angular-modles-controllers

This is simply a repo of the code I write while going through Anthony Alicea's [AngularJS course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-angularjs/)

It might look weird that I'm learning such an outdated framework, but it's because of the legacy code I have to work with at my current job.
